### I. Project Motivation

I was interested to analyze this data set to find out some insight about AirBnB services. In this project I tried to answer the following questions using Seattle Airbnb data:

Question 1: What is the busiest day of the week and month?

Question 2: The top 5 property types of AirBnB have the most in Seattle?

Question 3: What was the monthly revenue of Airbnb in Seattle in 2016?
